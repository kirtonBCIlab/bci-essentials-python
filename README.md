# bci-essentials-python
This repository contains python modules and scripts for the processing of EEG-based BCI. 
These modules are specifically designed to be equivalent whether run offline or online.

This is the test

## Getting Started

BCI Essentials requires Python 3.9 or later.  To install for Windows, MacOS or Linux:

```
pip install bci-essentials
```

On some systems, it may be necessary to install [liblsl](https://github.com/sccn/liblsl).  Alternatively, use the Conda [environment](https://github.com/kirtonBCIlab/bci-essentials-python/blob/main/environment.yml) to set up dependencies that are not provided by pip:

```
conda env create -f ./environment.yml
conda activate bci
```

## Offline processing
Offline processing can be done by running the corresponding offline test script (ie. mi_offline_test.py, p300_offline_test.py, etc.)
Change the filename in the script to point to the data you want to process.
```
python examples/mi_offline_test.py
```

## Online processing
Online processing requires an EEG stream and a marker stream. These can both be simulated using eeg_lsl_sim.py and marker_lsl_sim.py.
Real EEG streams come from a headset connected over LSL. Real marker streams come from the application in the Unity frontend.
Once these streams are running, simply begin the backend processing script ( ie. mi_unity_backend.py, p300_unity_bakend.py, etc.)
It is recommended to save the EEG, marker, and response (created by the backend processing script) streams using 
[Lab Recorder](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-LabRecorder) for later offline processing.
```
python examples/mi_unity_backend.py
```
